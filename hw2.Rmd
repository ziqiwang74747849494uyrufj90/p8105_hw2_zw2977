```

After merging the data, I have `r dim(data)[1]` observations and `r dim(data)[2]` variables. The total weight of trash collected by Professor Trash Wheel is `r sumw` and total number of cigarette butts collected by Gwynnda in July of 2021 is `r sumx`.




Problem 3


```{r}
MCI_baseline <- read.csv("MCI_baseline.csv", skip = 1)



```
I use read.csv to read the raw data, however the first contains the metadata, which describes the information of encoding. male = 1 female = 0. Thus I read the data from the second line command (skip =1).


```{r}

MCI_baseline.x <- MCI_baseline %>%
              mutate(Sex = ifelse(Sex == 1,"Male","Female"),
              apoe4 = ifelse(apoe4 == 1,"carriers", "Non-carriers")) 


Mean_age <- MCI_baseline.x %>% pull(Current.Age) %>% mean()



MCI_baseline.x %>% filter(Sex == "Female") %>% pull(apoe4) %>% table()


mci_amyloid <- read.csv("mci_amyloid.csv", skip = 1)

mci_amyloid.x <- mci_amyloid %>%
                  drop_na(Baseline) %>%  #remove non applicable value
                  filter(Baseline != "Na") #remove the artifical na value
```

There are `r dim(MCI_baseline.x)[1]` participants were recruited, and of these `r dim(nomissing.onset)[1]` develop MCI. The average baseline age is `r mean_age`. The proportion of women in the study are APOE4 carriers is `r 63/(63+148)`



```{r}

id_in_MCI_baseline <- MCI_baseline.x %>% filter(!ID %in% mci_amyloid.x$Study.ID)
id_in_mci_amyloid <- mci_amyloid.x %>% filter(!Study.ID %in% MCI_baseline.x$ID)



data <- MCI_baseline.x %>%
  rename(Study.ID = ID) %>%
  left_join(mci_amyloid.x, by ="Study.ID")

write.csv(data,"modified.data.csv")


```
Those ID are only in MCI_baseline but not in mci_amyloid: `r id_in_MCI_baseline$ID`, and Those ID are only in mci_amyloid but not in MCI_baseline: `r id_in_mci_amyloid$Study.ID`.


According to the exclusion criterion, I exclude the patients with missing baseline value. After combing the baseline and amyloid data, I have a dataset with `r dim(data)[1]` observations and `r dim(data)[2]` variables in a wide format. The data constains demograhpic charactors like sex and age, as well as baseline data and 4 visits for Î² 42/40 ratios.
